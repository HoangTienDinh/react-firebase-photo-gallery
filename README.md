## Instagram Clone
Built to practice using [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and learn [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for back-end as a service (using Firestore for DB and Storage for Files). [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) was used for the animations on the progress bar, image loading, and modal.
